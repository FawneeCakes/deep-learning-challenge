# deep-learning-challenge

Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

I used Co-lab for the challenge.  I was unable to get this to work in my VS Code.  Co-lab was the easier option.

Answers to challenge questions:

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
The target variable for the model is the "success" or "failure" of funding applicants

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
Information about the applicanIt included; classification, application type, affiliation, organization, status etc.

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Variables removed: EIN and NAME
